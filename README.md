# 🎨 Image Colorization using OpenCV & Deep Learning

A Python-based project that converts grayscale images into realistic color images using **OpenCV** and **deep learning models**.  

This project demonstrates my interest in **computer vision** and **image processing**.

## 🚀 Demo
- Input (grayscale) → Output (colorized)

*(Add before/after images or a GIF here for better presentation)*

---

## 📖 Features
- Upload grayscale images and convert them to color
- Uses **pre-trained deep learning model** for image colorization
- Simple command-line / script interface (can be extended to GUI or web app)
- Built with Python and OpenCV

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- Pre-trained deep learning model (Caffe / similar)
